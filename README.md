Percolate
-------------

A simple web interface to visualize percolation in a square surface using the Union-Find data structure. 

Clone the repo:

```
$ cd web
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

To run a simulation to verify that the *percolation threshold* is ~0.5927 for large squares, run the python code. Find the results in the generated csv file.

```
$ cd py
$ python percolate.py
```
